"As the prevalence of mental health conditions varies based on age and gender (Dos Reis & Culotta, 2015), we formed control group of users by matching each user in our ADHD database to another user by age, gender, and period of activity. We obtained the age and gender estimates by using lexica developed by (Sap et al., 2014). Overview of the data pipeline is shown in Figure 1. Then, we selected users with a minimum of 500 words across all their posts so that we have sufficient language for analysis. This retained 1,032 users with ADHD and 1,029 users in the control group. The average age in the cohorts was 23 years, with 637 females in the ADHD group and 639 in the control group."
