"As you said in point 3, mental health diagnostic criteria are a tool for diagnosing and treating people who experience distress from their cognitive process. Doctors and psychiatrists exist to give medical advice and treat people who need help, not to tell them how their brain works out of curiosity. On that point though, depression and anxiety are two completely different things, I&#x27;ve experienced both (separately and simultaneously) and they&#x27;re distinctly different in how they feel and how one would describe the symptoms to a doctor or a friend.<p>I went to the doctor in my mid-20s to get treated for ADHD, as it was causing me significant problems in my life, having gone through bouts of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation for the year or two prior, which the manifested itself in an inability to manage the negative traits of my ADHD. I&#x27;ve had it all my life, but only realised I likely had it a couple of years prior, but it was never something that caused big enough problems to go to a doctor about, mostly just report cards stating &quot;easily distracted and distracters others&quot;.<p>At the same time I was diagnosed with ADHD, the doctor said it was likely I also had high functioning autism. I guess maybe I have it, but it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s ever caused me any particular problems in life, so the doctor basically said not to worry about it and only to seek treatment (therapy or counselling) if I felt like I needed it. Same story for the ADHD too, he said there was no need to continue seeking treatment if I felt like I didn&#x27;t need it at any point in the future.<p>On the other hand, being put on medication for ADHD (clonidine and dexamphetamine) has made a world of difference for me, and I&#x27;ve seen vast improvements in quality of life. Most importantly though has been recognising and accounting for the fact that my mind functions in a different way than most people, and making accomodations (and asking others to accomodate) for this.<p>Interestingly enough, he also mentioned the possibility of having bipolar disorder as well, but said that it was likely the symptoms were actually ADHD masquerading as bipolar and decided to treat the ADHD first and see if the symptoms remain. Diagnosing mental health issues is a difficult task, a lot of people with ADHD are misdiagnosed with bipolar, or people with bipolar diagnosed with clinical depression. If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I was fairly certain that I had ADHD when I went to the doctor, I wonder what I would&#x27;ve been diagnosed with.<p>I think the language around mental functioning and disorders isn&#x27;t great.<p>If you have Asperger&#x27;s or ADHD and don&#x27;t experience distress or difficulty in life from it, then it&#x27;s not really a mental illness or disorder, it&#x27;s just a different way your mind works. ADHD has a particularly bad name, it&#x27;s not an attention deficit to begin with, but rather an inability to chose what your attention is on (you should see me if I&#x27;m in a hyperfocus&#x2F;flow state, it&#x27;s definitely not a deficit of attention), and it&#x27;s not always hyperactive. I have primarily inattentive-type ADHD, you wouldn&#x27;t pick me as having it just from looking at me, I display barely any &quot;typical&quot; traits of ADHD, it&#x27;s mostly mental for me (mood swings, inattentiveness, impulsiveness, poor working memory, no concept of time, rejection sensitivity and a lack of emotional permanence). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intrinsically a disorder either, it&#x27;s been hugely beneficial in parts of my life, and I don&#x27;t really want to be labelled as disordered or broken for the entirety of my life, it only became a disorder at a certain point in my life, largely due to external factors at the time. Often it&#x27;s helped me function above and ahead of neurotypical people.<p>I know plenty of people with ADHD who don&#x27;t take any medication and don&#x27;t feel the need to, and get by perfectly fine in life. My father very likely has ADHD (it&#x27;s hereditary, and he displays a lot of traits), and has never seeked treatment for it, and he&#x27;s a very successful man. Same for people with bipolar, autism, or other neurodiverse minds.",toomanybeersies,1589124618
"Thank you. Every time I set down my wallet, keys, phone, and pocket equipment and whenever it&#x27;s time to pick everything up. I lose everything. I have lost my wallet + cash roughly 6-9 times this year so far and probably like 4k cash.<p>I always miss deadlines and forget everything, I was diagnosed with ADHD with a child, but went along with the narrative that I was just lazy, or didn&#x27;t have discipline, or was just an underachiever(even though everyone would insist I was very smart), some of my friends when I graduated high school going to MIT&#x2F;Princeton told me. &quot;Dude, cmon you should be here with us, what&#x27;s going on?&quot;.<p>So I resolved many times so far to try harder and that I was just lazy, and gained many times extreme inspiration, inspiration that almost all in my life say they&#x27;ve personally never experienced, but always I would lose my path. I would just, forget... then one day on the bottom of depression and people around me picking up on my anxiety issues, people around me kept picking up on observations of me and recommended I try to get professional help.<p>I know now I <i>actually</i> have this fucking thing, and that for me it&#x27;s so bad that even if I know that some task is due that will cause me impending doom in a matter of a few days on even 3 hrs. I will always just get distracted, or forget some deadline. Over, and fucking over again, but if I actually remember to take this stupid fucking medication that i&#x27;m given. My life is normal again and I can actually achieve the performance my peers&#x2F;teachers&#x2F;community has always expected of me.<p>Through fucking countless suffering and being told i&#x27;m a lazy piece of shit, dumbass kid is always late to class even though I arrived to school early because I got distracted. I found that i&#x27;m not always like that. I have PLENTY of emotional baggage, and my personal life is 40x crazier than what i&#x27;m allowed to post here(Friends in prison in recent years).<p>But this DISORDER, however ill-specified it is or what everyone&#x27;s fucking problem it is. Taking my medication daily or SOMETHING will help me achieve. So when I&#x27;m not distracted i don&#x27;t crash into the fucking car in front of me or the side pavement of the freeway to check my phone impulsively over and over again.<p>Lol. You people have no fucking idea what you do to me with your armchair bullshit opinions, and you have <i>NO</i> idea how much it&#x27;s hurt me over the years. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I haven&#x27;t had the attention spamn to notice my tire is flat or THIS, OR THAT. Is happening. Some times, I just get distracted by whatever activity that I forget to eat for like 2-3 days straight, and thus at 5&#x27;7 am roughly 100~ish pounds.",eruditely,1395090855
"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 12. Classic, &quot;textbook&quot; example of one. I felt like it was a curse until I was about 20. I was put on Focalin, Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse over those years.. they all made me calm and focused. Without my meds, I used to live in my head all day, theorizing how the universe and neurons work.. playing with ideas, twisting shapes in my mind. I was also prone to depression, anxiety, and I hated dealing with emotions.<p>Then one day, when I was about 23, I did LSD and cannabis together. My whole world came crashing down, and I realized that ADHD was a label that limited my true potential, and made me judgmental of &quot;neurotypicals&quot;. After my trip, I realized that I lost about 75% of my visual-spatial ability (I felt out of it for a year or so as I missed having that ability), but I also felt more at peace, open-minded, and in the present moment. I also became a &quot;doer&quot;, rather than a &quot;thinker&quot;. I do not use any meds at all now; I meditate in the morning for at least 20 minutes, and try to run at least once a week.<p>With that said, I still like variety, and am a jack of all trades. Last time I did freelance, I loved doing marketing research, design, coding, programming and social media.",kurage,1414904511
"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was probably in 2nd grade and took Adderall, Ritalin and Concerta. I stopped taking them about 3 months prior to finishing my Bachelors of Computer Science. I have now been 8 months with out it and have been working at my new job quite well. Prior to that for the last 2 years of my education I would only take my medication when I needed to study hard or had a test.",lothia,1272324572
"I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult in my thirties and I have been taking medication for the last two years. I am also in EU.<p>I would recommend two things (YMMV). First, use ADHD to your advantage. People with ADHD have tendency to be inquisitive, but easily bored. Because of this I have become a jack of all trades. Although I have my specialty (ML), employers really appreciate that I also able to do Linux administration, create a web app and write a paper.<p>The second thing would be going freelance. I&#x27;ve done that last year, and it has been a blessing so far. I learned many new skills in new industries. Meeting new people and learning from them has been a valuable experience. The projects can be short enough not to get bored there. As a solid full-stack engineer you can earn better money, and have longer breaks in between.",jacek,1644315721
"Like many my age and younger, I was diagnosed with ADD as a child (I'm 32 now) and went through the entire gamut of meds (stimulants, tricyclics, SSRIs) before discovering that norepinephrine seems to be the culprit for me.  I have a very difficult time coding when I'm off the meds (I can do it, it's just difficult to keep the data structures and control flow in my head).  I took atomoxetine for several years and it worked wonders, but it caused severe side effects that I wasn't willing to put up with.  I've since switched to buproprion, which isn't quite as effective, but otherwise doesn't give me any problems.  The most general way I can describe the difference between being medicated and unmedicated is ""sharp"" and ""dull"", extremely so.<p>I have a friend that says if I can't do my job without medication, I'm in the wrong profession.  He may be right, but I love working with computers, and I don't have that passion for anything else, so I'll keep taking the meds.  I'm no longer interested in debating the ethics, since for me it really is the difference between high performance and average performance, and there is no reward for average.",pault,1327868447
"As time has gone on the less sympathetic I&#x27;ve gotten to labels like &quot;ADHD&quot; and the more I&#x27;ve thought we should just make amphetamines not require a dx, although they should probably still require a doctors supervision.<p>The whole concept that a doctor has to say there&#x27;s something wrong with you to get drugs I find to be very patronising.  If somebody has trouble focusing, they can just take some drugs and fill out some planners, they don&#x27;t need to be labelled using an acronym.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced ADHD is an illness either, but this isn&#x27;t really specific to ADHD, I&#x27;m pretty sceptical of the entire DSM model and our need to give people a label or a combination of labels.  I was diagnosed with ADHD in the aftermath of the most extreme abuse of my life because I didn&#x27;t focus in class.  I think a lot of the point of the label was making the adults feel like they were &quot;helping me with an illness&quot; rather than making an abused kid swallow strong drugs in order to keep up in this unforgiving world.  In the entire diagnostic process nobody so much as asked me what had happened in the previous year.<p>Even when I hear arguments like this, it&#x27;s pleading practicality and nessecity.  We need the label so he can get these drugs.  We need the label so we can do X and Y.  Only the label can give me true understanding of who I really am.  But the label is incidental to all of this stuff, there&#x27;s no reason you actually need this specific label.  I&#x27;m almost certain the main reason we have these labels at all is so present the labelled as pathetic enough to be worthy of insurance coverage.",faeriechangling,1665799671
"I agree with all the above. I eventually figured out why people work at Starbucks. Be nomadic. I've been exploring the idea of ""hacking field trips"": taking a train somewhere (which itself I've heard works) and staying with a friend to spend the downtime with.<p>On a related note, when I was a teenager, I was diagnosed with ADD (no H) but was not told. Instead of medication, my parents took me to a behaviorist who insisted I always ""get ready"" for tasks that required focus. Even if it was the weekend and I was at home, I should take a shower, get dressed, and ""splash on some cologne"" before I even attempted to do my homework. He was real big on natural light too. In my case alertness and depression never seem to coincide.",hparra,1300447057
"I was diagnosed with ADHD almost twenty years ago as a young adult. In my experience learning about how your mind works and spending time to come up with the best system and techniques to keep yourself on task is absolutely critical and should be worked on by any adult with ADHD. I would say that long-term it is more important than medication.<p>With that said, medication is also quite helpful. In my experience it provided a quick and independent support to my feeling better and productive. I found them critical when the controls I had built for myself proved insufficient or had collapsed. For example, when I moved from an office job to remote work I found the change and the lack of societal pressure to be focused on work left me in disarray. Medication helped me stand myself back up and find the routines and structures that worked in the new environment. As I built these support structures up I found the need for medication was reduced and stopped taking medication for many years. Years later, after a cross-country move which came with the loss of local friends and community I found it necessary to restart. I prefer to not take medication unnecessarily so one day I may be at the point where I stop taking them again, but I&#x27;m not there yet.<p>My advice would be to try medication if your gut says you need it but if you already feel fairly happy and productive then it may not be necessary.",yfiapo,1597199464

It helps you focus on one thing at a time, which can be hard enough for people even w&#x2F;o this diagnosis.",khorwitz,1430648432
"I'm 26, and I was diagnosed with ADD last year, at the suggestion of my dad, who was not diagnosed until his 40's.  It took me almost a year to start actively researching ADD, because I grew up in an upper-middle-class community where it was primarily over-diagnosed in unmotivated kids whose parents were convinced that brain dysfunction was the only thing that could <i>possibly</i> keep their children from being A students.  To say the very least, I was skeptical.<p>When I finally began learning about ADD, I was startled by how standard my story was.  Reading <i>Driven To Distraction</i> was a watershed experience for me; at times I was convinced that they had simply copy-and-pasted my academic transcript: ""<i>Dreamer</i>,"" ""<i>Has a creative mind that would produce incredible results if he applied himself once in a while</i>,"" ""<i>Inconsistent. What happened to the A student sitting in my classroom last year?</i>""<p>In perspective, so much suddenly made sense; not just my experiences in high school, but beyond that as well.  I failed only one class in my entire academic career, a programming course in my second year of college.  How ironic and confusing that my only failure would be in the subject for which I had the most passion.  Now it made sense.  Only two or three years ago from today, I almost lost my job because my output was so inconsistent.  I barely scraped by and recovered, but the experience shook me.  Now, I understood.<p>There are many forms of treatment, all of which I have experimented with.  When it comes to medication, it took me a long time to settle on Adderall, which lets me focus like a normal person without any appreciable side-effects.  The drug was a game-changer for me, like the first time I put on glasses.<p>I think I'm glad that I wasn't medicated as a kid, if only because of a deep uncertainty about medicating something as malleable as a child's brain.  Conversely, going 25 years without diagnosis has also drastically affected every part of my life.  (I have no idea how my dad dealt with it for almost 50 years.)  This was also something that I grew to understand as I learned more about ADD; undiagnosed, it can lead to perennial struggles with depression, self-esteem, poor impulse control and a host of others.  I think the most important thing about ADD isn't necessarily medication or even ""treatment"" but simply <i>awareness</i>.<p>""Laziness"" is a symptom, not a root cause.  If we can be mindful about the signs of ADD in childhood, we have already taken a huge step towards improving the quality of life for people with the disorder, and everyone they interact with.  I'm sure there will be debates about how to treat it for many years to come, but simple awareness can only help.",mcantor,1313164009
"I was diagnosed with ADHD AFTER college. I had always performed well in school so there was no cause for alarm growing up. But I was always a spacey kid--my mind would race all over the place and I had trouble focusing on one single thing. Except when I hyperfocus. Then I have a hard time hearing other people around me.<p>The worst? My mother was a psychiatrist. You&#x27;d think should would&#x27;ve caught it.<p>During college, I coped by making my life as busy and stressful as possible. That helped me get stuff done. I also play(ed) sports. Now I am in med school and I take medications as-needed. Med school is sufficiently challenging so I find it easier to focus now compared to my previous 9-5 programming job.",kendallpark,1440994639
"I used to be really anxious and nervous until sophomore year of high school, when I had to take a marketing elective aimed towards juniors. We had to present our products via PowerPoint each week in a group. My first two presentations were terrible, so I racked up enough courage to ask my teacher on whether I could present alone next week, which he allowed.<p>Every week or so, I&#x27;d ask him to present my products as a single-person group in front of the class and every week I got pretty good feedback which led to getting better grades. That increased my confidence, and also became the pipeline towards learning how to reduce the amount of (pardon my language) fucks I gave about unnecessary things. (Also, trying to convince your classmates and teacher to buy a fake product every week or two works wonders for your anxiety.)<p>I did know how to be a team player and collaborate with other people, but the group I was usually assigned to sucked and I refused to let them affect my grade average.<p>I also started going to the gym that year, did nothing too serious though. I&#x27;d go after school and would either use the treadmill or pretend that I knew how to lift weights, haha. It made me feel better, and I was diagnosed with ADHD later on, so the exercise bit checks out even more.<p>Tl;dr: find something that you feel strongly enough for, and use that to take-off into the anxiety to less anxiety pipeline. Also, exercise. It doesn&#x27;t have to be working out intensely, but even a walk around the neighborhood can make you feel better.",antihoney,1648370068
"It would surprise me if someone was able to sleep while influenced by stimulants. However, being on stimulants is very exhaustive for your body, and it temporarily stops the racing thoughts many people struggle with, even some time after taking it.<p>I was having quite severe insomnia when I was younger and it all cleared around the time I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed stimulants. My insomnia doesn&#x27;t seem to return when I&#x27;m on holidays or during weekends, periods which I usually don&#x27;t take any medication.<p>I asked my doctor about it, and he said it could be related, but it could also just be that I grew out of it, or any number of other reasons. He did say that some doctors was been experimenting with very low doses before going to bed with various degree of success. But it was a high risk that these people was suffer from some kind of undiagnosed variant of ADHD or another where insomnia typically is a comorbid disorder, like bipolar disorder.",vegardx,1579163722
"I was diagnosed with ADD in the third grade. I think i was probably one of the last to be properly diagnosed as A.D.D before it became the catch all diagnosis. I spent a day worth of testing at my doctors office, and probably a week worth of testing over the next month at school taking different tests.<p>I took Ritalin or Concerta (a long release form of Ritalin) from 3rd grade to most of the way through college. And i can say for a fact that i would not have made it through high school with out it.<p>When i got to college im not sure what happened, i either outgrew the ADD, or adapted, i stopped taking it around the end of my 2nd year.",ericcumbee,1358534030
"I was diagnosed with ADHD 7 months ago. The diagnosis and medication have been life-changing.<p>I was &#x27;high-functioning&#x27;, in much the same way as OP: stable marriage, successful career, not much savings but at least not in any debt.<p>But I also suffered from depression, anxiety, extreme procrastination, substance abuse, risky and impulsive behaviour.<p>Of course I saw psychiatrists, and they stopped listening the moment I said &quot;depression&quot; and prescribed the usual drugs, which did nothing for me. Luckily my 3rd psychiatrist listened a bit better and referred me for tests.<p>Since diagnosis I have started medication (methylphenidate&#x2F;Ritalin, the only real option in the country I live in) my life has significantly improved. My procrastination is almost entirely gone (now maybe 4 hours a week &quot;wasted&quot; instead of 3+ days of being unable to do anything productive), my work performance is drastically improved, I&#x27;m losing weight (no longer dopamine-hunting with food), my wife says I&#x27;m doing more &#x27;chores&#x27; and forgetting little things (spoon in the sink instead of the dishwasher) less often.<p>My depression and anxiety have disappeared. I still get overwhelmed in loud&#x2F;busy environments. I still have emotional overreactions to small annoyances. I still forget things, and procrastinate a little. But the key thing is acceptance. I <i>understand</i> why these things are happening now, and that understanding makes them less hard to do live with.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t start medication (and I suggest you do, it&#x27;s provably incredibly effective for most cases) the biggest thing you can do is learn. You will be amazed for the first 6 months at least that such a massive amount of your life has truly been affected and so much of your &#x27;unique personality&#x27; is shared with other ADHD adults.<p>My psychiatrist answered my same question &quot;How can I have ADHD if my life is like this?&quot; with &quot;But how hard was it?&quot;. Success despite ADHD doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t exist. It just means you developed coping strategies for your deficiencies. And if you&#x27;re in therapy for family issues then clearly those strategies are not working sufficiently.",richthegeek,1623762117

"I fought so hard through every year at school. At home, computers let my mind explode in computer games, 3D realms and unlimited feeling exploring of operating systems and hardware.<p>The only way to control my thoughts and mind was ridiculous amounts of exercise, 1 hour run daily or equivalent and drinking 5 cups of coffee per workday, <i>just to have a normal focus</i>.<p>Somehow, after living a very random 20&#x27;s. I graduated with a bachelor and a master degree. My life was a still a mess, but at least I graduated.<p>Something had to be wrong. The thought had occured to me, is this ADHD, but I surpressed it.

-- Sequential tasks (doing something from A through to Z) like doing the dishes, cleaning my room, or building a spreadsheet model over 7 hours - no problem.
- Frustrated thougts and mild depression over lack of life progress completely evaporated

- After this, I got 5 job interviews with great companies, 2 job offers with high salaries
- I now work in the world&#x27;s largest technology &amp; strategy consulting company.
- I was just promoted, fast tracked
- I just got a raise
- My bank now believes in me financially and is about to offer me a mortage to buy an apartment
- My diagnosis and medication has given a fantastic life where all my opportunities are within reach. #RealLifeLimitless",adhdthrow,1478076820

"Interesting stuff. I was diagnosed with ADHD 12 years ago (after undergoing testing because I suspected I might). I tried various medications and after several years found that Adderall XR worked best. Tolerance is real, though, and I’ve had to increase my dose over the years, but I take half doses some days and skip when I can, which subjectively seems to help.<p>The symptoms are definitely the sort of thing everyone can identify with to some extent. But I think the key detail in the definition of ADHD is that it’s a “disorder”. In other words, these symptoms are normally distributed but if the combination of them occurs often and causes distress to the patient and&#x2F;or other people, then it’s real. Two people with exactly the same symptoms but different life situations or jobs such that one experiences distress and the other none should be diagnosed differently. Not everything can or should be reduced to objective ratings.<p>I’d also like to echo the observation that the restrictions and hurdles involved in getting an ADHD diagnosis and in acquiring stimulant medication for ADHD are seemingly designed to vex the ADHD sufferer far more than a neurotypical individual. I used to have to, once a month, call my doctors office to ask for a new prescription, then physically go there to pick it up, physically deliver it to the pharmacy, and then physically pick up the medication when it was available. Which isn’t always right away since Adderall is so commonly prescribed (and because my health insurance has an insane restriction that only covers the brand name—but that’s a different story). That’s three or four steps not required for the vast majority of medication that are each easy for an ADHD sufferer to forget, put off, or otherwise screw up. Laws have changed where I live recently so that I only have to deal with the doctors office once every three months but the physical delivery is still a requirement. Thankfully I live near the doctors office and have a flexible job. Most people aren’t so lucky.<p>So ironically it’s far easier for folks without ADHD to deal with getting Adderall than it is for those of us with the disorder. C’est la vie!<p>Edit: I also wanted to mention that I’ve found that I’m actually much more agreeable and less irritable when I’m on Adderall than not. My family has witnessed the difference and told me as much, and I feel it too. Whether that’s a direct effect of the stimulant or a secondary effect of the behavioral changes it engenders I don’t know but it’s worth noting that the potential personality changes aren’t all negative.",skywhopper,1514650694
"Your description of ADHD is 100%, but for anyone trying to deal with this issue I would be very careful with meds prescribed from doctors, because for some of them it is mostly a big business. I was diagnosed with ADHD many years ago and prescribed with Ritalin and then an extended version of it (basically releasing throughout the whole day) and while it made me more productive, I experienced horrible jittering, crashes and I just did not feel like myself, but more like a zombie&#x2F;junkie. I think it is scary that even 6-years old kids are prescribed with these pills nowadays.<p>pro tip: I was trying to find a natural solution, which for me is DMAE combined with fish-oil. It has basically the same effect for me in terms of productivity without the nasty side effects + you can buy it in every vitamin store. It is funny how I can almost immediately (within few days) notice when I stop taking these.",michalpt,1492055113
"For a long time I felt (and now feel) the same as you. I just wanted to share an experience that, while completely anecdotal, is perhaps atypical, and has been one of the defining experiences of my life.<p>I got the Internet as a birthday present on my 8th birthday, and pretty much disappeared from normal society for the next few years. The Internet was (and is) fascinating - I could learn anything, interact with people I&#x27;d never met with, and, notably, do adult things without anyone doubting me because I was young.<p>But as I got older, the Internet, and therefore my mind, just got busier. Eventually it was not only random articles and a few chatrooms, but dozens of apps and sites that are programmed to give us a dopamine hit. Being online to me feels like walking around in a casino trying not to gamble.<p>I don&#x27;t think I concentrated on one thing for more than 20 minutes for years, and outside of school I didn&#x27;t have to. So I just convinced myself that school was archaic, skipped as much class as I could, and ended up a mental butterfly. It was working for me.<p>Except for when I wanted to get stuff done. I probably started learning to program 100 times, but I would get distracted with cat pictures or something, and even though I loved computers more than anything else, I couldn&#x27;t do much to create with them. I was diagnosed with ADHD, but I didn&#x27;t really care; I don&#x27;t think that experience is unique to either me or people who have been diagnosed with ADHD.<p>Then, all of the sudden, I went on a Mormon mission in eastern Ukraine. Two years with 30 minutes of Internet a week (at an Internet club 45 mins away from my apartment). My entire life was structured in a way I never would have structured it in order to get me to concentrate on the things I considered most important for that period of time.<p>My mind slowed down - in an almost literal sense. I had only finished a couple of books in my <i>entire life</i> before the mission, and on the mission I could easily read the Old Testament for hours on end, paying attention to intricacies of text I never would have realized before.<p>Then I got home. I jumped on Facebook, and right back into my old habits. My mind was gone for weeks. Not gone in the sense that I wasn&#x27;t learning anything -- I would pick up tidbits here and there, but I never got deep enough into anything to make any of that learning useful. It terrified me.<p>So now I spend a lot of time on very strict information diets. I severely limit my time on HN, Reddit, Facebook. I try to keep my reading on a Kindle so the Internet isn&#x27;t even an option. I would <i>love</i> for someone to create an app (that works) that limits what sites I can use so I can go into &quot;wired in&quot; mode when I&#x27;m programming.<p>In short, don&#x27;t be afraid to place restrictions on yourself. Let your mind slow down.",austenallred,1417900696

I was diagnosed with ADHD around the 3rd grade (2 separate psychiatrists diagnosed me) and have never heard about diets as working above all others.

"&#62;Stated with such certainty. What evidence do you have that the commenter here in particular didn't develop in some way as they grew up?<p>No evidence, speaking from personal experience and the belief that ADD is over diagnosed.<p>I don't find it hard to believe there are millions of students unable to focus in public school. What I find hard to believe is that medication is the answer. Sure its an easy answer for those teachers to have their students sit quietly in the classroom for 50-90 minutes with little interruption and be expected to focus on subjects that relate little to their life with little or no control over what and how they study. I was diagnosed with ADD, and I had these views about 12 years ago to when I was diagnosed. I'll stick to cabbage, green tea, and the occasional meditation to help with my so called add.",TechNewb,1358544579
"I imagine most of the stories you&#x27;ll hear here are going to talk about how transformative a diagnosis was and the immense positive change most people have felt after starting medication. I do think this is probably the most common experience but my personal experience is a lot more mixed, and my relationship with my ADHD diagnosis and medication is complicated.<p>To start with, it wasn&#x27;t a surprise when I was diagnosed as an adult. Teachers suggested I get tested for ADHD throughout my entire childhood but my parents held off since I wasn&#x27;t a disruptive student, did well academically, and had often voiced an interest in joining the military and a childhood diagnosis of ADHD could potentially be disqualifying.<p>Ultimately though my goals changed and ended up going to graduate school with an aim to study cognitive science. That&#x27;s when I decided to get tested, and not surprisingly, I was diagnosed with ADHD predominately inattentive subtype and prescribed Vyvanse. The change was profound. Before medication I would start books and never complete them, but suddenly I was finishing several books a month. I found keeping tack of things and cleaning and organizing my environment became second nature where I had struggled deeply with those things before. It also lead me to a career in tech. Prior to starting medication I had always had an appreciation for formal systems and logic, but Vyvanse super-charged that. I was suddenly able to deeply engage with math and formal logic in a way I hadn&#x27;t been able to before because of my lack of focus. I became interested in software development. Taking Vyvanse and writing code became probably my favorite activity, and it&#x27;s because of medication and my ADHD diagnosis that I ultimately became a software developer. I excelled at coding because I loved doing it. I would pop a Vyvanse and code for hours. Ultimately however, it became the only thing I really enjoyed. I would take an extra pill to stay up late and finish tasks, or get work done on a side-project. I ended up taking more than prescribed and I would run out before my refill was available leading me to have huge surges of productivity at the beginning of the month and huge periods of inactivity at the end when I was out of pills and suffered rebound effects like a complete inability to focus and extreme fatigue from not sleeping or eating correctly while on meds. In the end I realized it was also starting to take a toll on my personal relationships since I was living in my head all of the time not giving my live-in girlfriend nearly enough attention and instead just working and coding. So I decided to quit. After quitting my productivity took a hit, but ultimately I was able to reach a decent level of performance, though no where near what I had been doing previously. But I realized I was no longer deeply engaged with my work and I ended up transitioning careers from software development to becoming a sales engineer&#x2F;solution architect.<p>Now, several years after quitting, I&#x27;m much happier. My live-in girlfriend is now my wife and I have a much better work-life balance. I&#x27;m still a bit of a workaholic, but I can disengage and maintain a better balance. Working as a sales engineer is also a really nice spot for my ADHD mind as constantly jumping between tasks and moving between technical and non-technical activities keeps me stimulated. I could never have done this job while on Vyvanse, as the focus I got from the meds would actually make it difficult for me to effectively move between so many different events in a day. Of course, I also can&#x27;t code like a used to, but I do still enjoy engaging deeply with technical topics of interest. The odd reality for me though is that without that diagnosis and the medication I never would have been able to find a role like the one that I have now, which is such a good match for my unmedicated brain. I was able to derive a foundational knowledge about tech and computer science that I use today because of medication, and I don&#x27;t know exactly where I would be if I hadn&#x27;t gone down that road initially.<p>Looking back it&#x27;s not too surprising I ended up abusing a prescription. Substance abuse disorder is a common comorbidity for people with ADHD and while that&#x27;s often attributed to self-medication, I don&#x27;t think that was the case for me. I just like altered states. I experimented with a range of drugs in college but it&#x27;s easy to put up boundaries around things like that when you know it&#x27;s recreational. When you&#x27;re using a prescribed medicine it&#x27;s much easier to justify the behavior. I think most people who are prescribed stimulants will take them correctly and will likely see a benefit from doing so. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an option for me though and I&#x27;ve found more success building a life compatible with my condition rather than trying to fight it. There was a now deleted site called Quitting Adderall[1] that shared other people&#x27;s similar experiences and it really resonated with me when I was considering the change.<p>That said there&#x27;s no obligation to take stimulant medication if you do pursue a diagnosis, and I wouldn&#x27;t tell you not to try stimulants if you think there could be benefit. I would just advise you to monitor yourself if you do take them, especially if you have a personal or family history of substance abuse.<p>1. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20210125224905&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;quittingadderall.com&#x2F;5-signs-that-youre-ready-to-quit-adderall&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20210125224905&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;quittingad...</a>",hob_code,1623770671

"I was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago when I was 30.<p>I tried a few medications.  When I as on Vyvanse, I noticed similar personality changes as what you described.  Most notably, my sense of humour suffered.  (And before on dexamphetamine, I was really grumpy when it wore off.  So I did get into fights.)<p>Things got better after I changed to methylphenidate.

Mindful meditation was also suggested, but I couldn't get into it. I started Adderall in July, but the PNS stimulation was too great, so I switched to Dexedrine 4 months ago.  Since starting the stimulants, my productivity has gone up 300%.

"I can confirm the author&#x27;s experience but from the opposite perspective. In third grade I was diagnosed with ADD. At that time the school didn&#x27;t know what to do with that, so I was segregated into an &quot;educationally handicapped&quot; class only available at another school across town. So, I had to ride the proverbial &quot;short bus&quot; (for the handicapped kids) and did the rest of elementary school in a &quot;special&quot; classroom in a temporary building isolated on its own from the &quot;normal&quot; classrooms. The other kids in my class had far more severe problems than mine, often both physically and emotionally. The class size was smaller but the teacher had to spend much of her time dealing with challenging issues.<p>Basically, unlike the author, who was told she was so smart, I was given every overt and covert signal that I was handicapped, both at school and at home. I was &quot;mainstreamed&quot; in middle school but was assigned to go to another &quot;special&quot; classroom for all core subjects. Again, this was the only different classroom on campus. It had double wide doors and actually had a small adjacent observing room with a two way mirror in-between. My fellow students were often so disruptive and required attention from the teacher that I was allowed to spend most classes alone in the &quot;observing closet&quot; reading. It was dark and pretty quiet. Some of my best memories of school actually.<p>When I was in 8th grade, every 8th grader in the state had to take the same standardized test. It was basically like a middle school SAT. I remember a few weeks after taking the test, the principle of the school came to my special classroom and told me I needed to retake that test, this time in his office while he watched. A week after that I was suddenly re-assigned from that &quot;special&quot; classroom to now take my core subjects not just in the normal classes but in &quot;accelerated&quot; classes for mentally gifted kids.<p>Obviously, I was simply not neuro-typical. I still struggled mightily with some subjects in school while succeeding wildly in others. My grades were &#x27;A&#x27;s and &#x27;D&#x27;s with little in-between. I dropped out of college because I just couldn&#x27;t get past some required classes. I taught myself computer programming, got deep into technology, got involved very early in a startup, then founded my own startup, then another, then another. Took one to IPO, two others to acquisitions. Stayed with a Fortune 500 acquirer as an executive and eventually ascended to the C-level. Now I&#x27;m well-known in my industry and considered a substantial &quot;success&quot; by most standards. I manage armies of incredibly sharp ivy league MBAs and Phds yet have no degree myself (and not for cool Zuckerberg reasons like dropping out of Havard). My Mom still says stuff like &quot;Out of all my kids... well, we thought we&#x27;d be caring for you when you grew up and now you&#x27;re caring for the whole family.&quot;<p>Bottom line, many people see my schooling experience as tragic, and it <i>was</i> truly awful in many ways, but I&#x27;ve always attributed my entrepreneurial drive and much of my success to the perverse experience of being told and treated as if I was handicapped. I worked harder because <i>everyone</i> told me that I&#x27;d always have to work harder and nothing would come easy for me. I didn&#x27;t give up when I failed because I mostly expected to fail.",mrandish,1559318329
"I was diagnosed with ADD as a kid. It turns out I was just bored. There are only 2 reasons for jumping around like this. Either you aren't that interested or you hit a knowledge roadblock.<p>The knowledge roadblock is probably the easier of the two to overcome. Join a local users group. My learning was highly stunted until I had people around me that could answer my (frequently dumb) questions face to face. Sites like stack overflow are great but they are no substitute for someone who can see the look on your face that you aren't getting it and change course accordingly.<p>Is building iOS apps something you really really really want to do or something that would be cool to know? Learning new things usually starts by sucking pretty hard. When the interest level dips below the difficulty level it is easy to move on to the next thing.

Attach a reward to getting it done and a penalty for failing to complete the task. Finally have someone to hold you accountable. When the pain of not getting it done is worse than the pain of doing it you will get it done.",bobfirestone,1339612773

"I&#x27;m just about to graduate from a top 10 computer science program myself so I can say that I&#x27;ve been in your shoes.<p>The first year adds a lot of pressure and challenge because of the transition to higher-level academics. In fact I often failed my own expectations (and literally failed a couple times too) at the beginning of my collegiate academic career.<p>I can assure you that if you start to take stimulants without a prescription or diagnosis as early as your first year, your situation will not improve. 3rd and 4th year classes are harder than intro classes or 2nd year classes, and stimulants will not change your mindset, approaches to studying, 
or priorities in a way that will accommodate you for higher difficulty courses.<p>You need to take a huge step back from academics and look at what is affecting your performance. Summer vacations and even internships are the best times for that because the stakes are not as high so you have time to reflect on who you are and what you want out of life.<p>In my first year summer, after a brutally tough semester, I worked a full-time + daily overtime job at a backalley convenience store in downtown Seattle to discover &quot;my bottom line&quot;. I wanted to see the kind of life I would lead if I didn&#x27;t get my act together. Looking back, I was exceedingly hard on myself. But that summer I learned a few things: 1) I never want to be so poor that I can&#x27;t buy daily essentials, 2) I never want to fall prey to addiction, 3) I want to fall in love with my work so I never have to actually &quot;work hard&quot; ever again, 4) I need to develop strategies to get my behavior together so I can follow through on all these ideals.<p>When I came back to school, although the transition wasn&#x27;t immediate I completely changed my lifestyles and approach to college.

"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child in the early 90s, before smartphones and PCs and all of this &quot;overstimulation&quot;.

I spent a lot of my childhood working around energy and inattention issues. In adulthood the symptoms subdued and got more subtle, harder to spot, but once I knew what to look for, I still checked all the boxes and it can still cause me problems.<p>ADHD is very real, but just because someone struggles to focus or plan doesn&#x27;t mean ADHD is the explanation. ADHD&#x27;s impact is wide-ranging and nuanced, with possible symptoms like &quot;emotional impermanence&quot; (you forget or disbelieve how someone feels about you if they haven&#x27;t told you very recently), or having &quot;time blindness&quot; (a poor sense of time, where it&#x27;s hard to process anything more nuanced than &quot;now&quot; and &quot;not now&quot;).

To make a long story short, I finally went to college, graduated at the top of my class, then went on to Stanford to earn an advanced degree. Now I have a job that I love.<p>I've been on this medication for almost 10 years. I never acclimated to it (in the sense of needing a higher dosage for the same effect) and the side effects are very mild (slight loss of appetite, slightly harder to sleep).<p>Recently I decreased the dosage by almost 50%. I've found that over the years I've somehow learned how to concentrate better, and that therefore my need for the med has decreased. This makes me think that my brain has somehow changed for the better. Perhaps all the concentrating I did while on a higher dosage served as practice and that the benefits from all this practicing apply even without the medication. Maybe some day I'll be able to get off of it completely. But for now I still have a tough time concentrating without it.",tim_h,1327881039
"I was diagnosed with ADD as a child, and have experienced firsthand the kind of dependencies these drugs can create.  I wasn't able to stop taking Dexedrine (essentially the same as Ritalin) until halfway through my first semester of college, when I undertook a daily practice of meditation.<p>Now I've come to realize that ""lack of attentiveness"" is part of the human condition.  We can make it worse by excessive stimulation and context-switching, but this unscientific idea of an ""inbuilt"" disability simply doesn't exist.",jayferd,1327860079
"&gt; I&#x27;m not convinced ADHD is an illness either<p>Do you believe you have ADHD now?<p>I was fortunate to have some FMRI (I believe that&#x27;s the tech) work done years ago, shortly after I was diagnosed with ADHD. The imagining made it so blatantly obvious that my brain was different than normal brains. Where a normal brain would light up like crazy for a given stimulus, mine looked like a black hole.<p>There are certainly bio&#x2F;physical differences.<p>That said, I came into this comment thinking I&#x27;d take the stance of &quot;of course it&#x27;s a disease,&quot; but I think I&#x27;ve warmed up somewhat to what I think is your argument: lets stop with the labels.<p>What holds me back from getting on board is that it&#x27;s not like a headache.

"Well, true. I have not disclosed to my job that I was diagnosed with ADHD, and I don&#x27;t particularly plan to (I wouldn&#x27;t deny it if it came up, but I&#x27;m not going to volunteer the information either). There are more downsides than upsides to disclosure. It&#x27;s generally recommended to not disclose, especially during the hiring process, unless you truly cannot cope in your job without some sort of ADA accommodation, in which case you must disclose for the ADA to kick in.<p>Plenty of people with ADHD choose not to take medication though, and I&#x27;m having trouble coming up with a situation in which a judge would order you to take it. As long as you&#x27;re not blaming your ADHD as a reason you broke the law (which you shouldn&#x27;t, ADHDers may have poor impulse control and bad executive function, but we still need to hold ourselves accountable for our actions), I don&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s the law&#x27;s business if you have it or don&#x27;t, or medicate it or don&#x27;t. There are plenty of non-medication coping strategies, including therapy and coaching.",cowpewter,1557767755
"I previously had a substance abuse problem with ketamine after self medicating for depression.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely spot on, I never had any physical cravings or withdrawal symptoms, as a typical addictive substance does. And when I couldn&#x27;t get hold of any, or went away and couldn&#x27;t use it, or something, I wasn&#x27;t compelled to seek it out.<p>But at home, it crept into becaming an &quot;every evening&quot; thing, then a &quot;morning&quot; thing, and slowly into an &quot;all day when I could get away with it&quot; thing.<p>It&#x27;s very, very easy to binge on ketamine. Especially in illicit powder form, administered nasally. It doesn&#x27;t take a huge amount of it to render you practically senseless, and your mind is in a totally different &quot;space&quot; almost, a sort of limitless sense of possibility and openness, a secret, esoteric reality of your own making. At the right dose and frequency, it can fill you with a sense of awe and wonder so profound that it really does make life feel magical and wondrous, even while not on the drug.<p>And when you emerge from that, a couple of lines and you&#x27;re back there. It&#x27;s powerfully psychologically addictive for that reason.<p>Years later I was diagnosed with ADHD, and found out that this kind of substance abuse is quite common for undiagnosed adults.  It&#x27;s not just a quick dopamine fix, but a kind of coping mechanism against a world that you have to otherwise fight against constantly. Something like ketamine just removes that entirely, you can just exit the world for some time and float off into space, where no one can expect you to have ordered executive function.<p>The article mentions him scoring ADHD medications; I wonder if this had more to do with it than any other factor.",lewispollard,1645724163

"This makes me think of a long time ago, when I was diagnosed with ADD as an adult. I started medicating with dexadrine, which really did work wonderfully. Changed my life.

"I was diagnosed with ADD in college and put on Dexedrine. It does an incredibly good job of helping you focus and help you get things done.<p>I feared the drug though and never took it as much as prescribed. I phased it out completely after a few years and later realized that there are other factors that can help just as much with your attention deficit. Sleep, diet, and exercise are insanely important. I believe a lot of people on drugs for ADD could just focus on these 3 things and effectively cure their ADD. Definitely not all people, I am sure there are plenty that need help, but a lot of the time I see it overprescribed (in my non-medical opinion). Just moving to a low carb diet helps a ton. Sleep helps a ton. Exercise helps you feel good and sleep well. On the flip side, bad sleep habits (like those you develop in college) lead to bad eating habits and bad exercise habits. It&#x27;s a vicious circle. Stimulants help you avoid those healthy habits with some of the same positive outcomes (at the expense of health).<p>I think you are crazy though if you think prolonged exposure to these drugs is fairly low risk. You build up a tolerance, you need to take more, and it does have long term effects. It seems like you are in your early 30&#x27;s so you may have been doing this routine for the past 10.

"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 17, after many years of living with it. I decided I would not take drugs for it. I was afraid I would lose my creativity and that kind of stuff. I started rescheduling my tasks so the most boring ones would get the time of the day I would me most inspired.
It helped for a time, but I couldn't stay in the same place for too long.
After some years frequently changing jobs, friends and hobbys, I finally found my place.
I've been programming since my childhood. Sometimes, ADHD helps (giving ideas on how to solve problems), some other times, it gets in the way, making me lazy to solve some repetitive problems.
After 4 or 5 different jobs, I found one where it doesn't get repetitive. I work in projects that last around six months. Each project uses a different language, with different teams and tools and routines. It's been like heaven.

"I was diagnosed with ADD. I'm not sure that was the problem, exactly, because there were some other things going on, but I was talking Adderall for almost two years, along with Wellbutrin. I quit cold-turkey and went through a long period of being almost totally exhausted both physically and mentally.<p>As I slowly recovered, I was more strict about my diet, got a lot more exercise, and started meditating. I found that vipassana-style meditation was a tremendous help.<p>This is speculation on my part, but I think that meditation really strengthens some of the areas that I'm weak in due to ADD. I think sitting still forces me to develop ""inhibition"" skills that are typically rather weak in people with ADD. Also, mindfulness develops memory skills that I've been having a lot of trouble with lately. Also, paying close attention to direct sensations and thoughts makes it a lot easier to relax, so I tend not to build up anywhere near as much stress through the day. The bottom line is that I have more energy and focus, and just seem to function a lot better when I meditate regularly.<p>I'd bet that you will get a lot of the same benefits from yoga, alone. But I'd like to suggest that you look into vipassana and see if it works well for you, too. I don't think you will have any trouble finding resources on the internet, but please let me know if you'd like some recommendations.",webnrrd2k,1327882017
"I&#x27;m curious if any others with a stutter have had a similar experience as myself.  I&#x27;ve always had a severe stutter, and spent many years in speech therapy learning to deal.

Of course, the stutter never got better, I just became better at managing it.<p>However, as an adult I was diagnosed with ADD and started to take a low dose of Adderall.  Of all the ways this was a positive influence in my life the largest change was that as long as I am medicated the stutter completely disappears.  I don&#x27;t know if I can put into words what a sense of relief this was :).  I will always remember the first time I spoke without analyzing and organizing every word before hand, one day a sentence just came out without a single thought.

I was diagnosed with ADHD. I live in South East Asia (always hot and humid) and found that the stimulants made me just too hot. Ended up trying modafinil. I would take it first day of the week get the momentum going and usually didn&#x27;t need it for the rest of the week until productivity waned.<p>I found that getting started and momentum going is my biggest challenge. Maintaining it for several days after was not as hard.,thelittleone,1579849889
"As a counterpoint, I was diagnosed with ADD (now known as ADHD-PI) a couple decades ago as a child and initially took medication for it, but complained about the effects and so my parents agreed to stop giving me medication. This kind of decision seems manageable at the time if you&#x27;re bright enough that you can skate through school regardless of how much work you actually do.<p>You cannot skate through adulthood this way. My condition, ADHD-PI, is characterized by the tendency to lose focus on dull activities while hyper-focusing on fun activities. If my current task is interesting then I could work even with a rock concert held 5 feet away. This sounds like a superpower but if a task is not interesting then the slightest distraction totally derails me. There are ways for me to trick myself but they are unreliable and my brain will eventually route around them.<p>I do my best to always work on something interesting, but this isn&#x27;t always possible and the productivity hit can be quite large. My solution was to get a prescription for Adderall XR. With the benefit of hindsight I regret ever going off medication. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s always necessary but if you have these problems, you&#x27;ve been diagnosed, and it&#x27;s severe enough that you have become depressed (this is very common among adults with ADHD) you should really consider it.",sobellian,1623763653

I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child (erroneously, I believe) and took medication everyday for <i>years.</i> A few years ago, I deemed it no way to live and weened myself off of it.<p>As a transitionary step, though, I guess I&#x27;d be open to it.<p>Ah, yes. I didn&#x27;t touch on sleep. It has wavered over the months. It&#x27;s better now, but not perfect. Often I sleep more than 8 hours, even though I have alarms set for 0800 and 0900.

And when these elements are out of sync, they result in the symptoms that together are recognized as ADHD.)<p>Point being that I&#x27;d be curious to see if the drop-off in reaction times correlates in any useful way to the rise in ADHD.

"Sorry for the long post, just wanted to put my perspective down for once.<p>I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was about 7-8, by advice of a teacher. 
If I had to put a severity to it, I'd guess severe. When I was in young, it was a physical feeling of pain in my stomach when I fought against the urge to stand up and walk around. 
Before I was diagnosed, I literally couldn't write my own name without help, because I wouldn't sit and do it. After being put on medication, I basically got straight A's and B's through to high school.<p>Half way through high school, I started to hate the medication, I was depressed and tried to take myself off them secretly. Within the first week, most of my teachers started raising eyebrows and the school called home to see what was going on. After a few trips to the paediatrician, psychologist, and agreeing to weekly therapy at the school, I was taken off the medication.<p>It got pretty grizzly. 
One of my teachers would routinely send me out of the classroom for entire periods because he figured I wasn't going to learn anyway, and I was disrupting everyone else. 
I started to struggle in classes I loved, which got incredibly frustrating, I remember clearly knowing the answer to a problem in math class, but struggling to actually write it down, or being in music class (I was the school bands drummer), and struggling to to finish a single song because I couldn't help standing up and stepping away from the drum kit half way through.<p>It was devastating to me to find I couldn't do these things I knew I was good at without the help of the medication I fought to get off. I'd get off of school and just walk around town. Somehow, one day, I ended up walking into the local TAFE/Curtin (This is in a town in Australia), and for some reason started looking at their class lists. One of the admin's started talking to me, and convinced me to go talk to one of the teachers, who convinced me to give it a try.<p>Being a small town, the classes were basically empty, so I was almost one on one with the teacher, who let me work through at my own pace. I ended up powering through all the work for the Certificate III and Certificate IV pretty quickly, and he asked me to enrol in the Diploma (For those that don't know, here in aus a Cert/Diploma is under an undergraduate degree), introduced me to the teacher, and she gave me the entire course load in advance, which I also powered through.<p>They called me in and sat me down and told me I should apply for an undergraduate degree program in the city, and wrote letters of recommendation for me. I did, not really expecting anything to come of it (Remember I was about 14-15 at the time, and still attending high school, and basically failing), and after a few weeks of frantic phone calls, and incredible support from my amazing parents, I got accepted.<p>I ended up graduating just after my 18th birthday, with an award for grades.<p>I think about it pretty regularly, what my life would have been like if I hadn't discovered programming via TAFE. I'm 100% certain I could not have finished high school without medication, with high enough marks to get into Uni. And even if I could have, I probably would have assumed that my body would fight me every step of the way just like high school, and opted not to go. I wish I could tell all the people who are in the position I was in at that age, terrified of the future, feeling trapped in a body that won't let them be normal, that, hey, maybe there ARE things you can do. I've described programming as a 'blind spot' for my ADHD. And if I have a blind spot, maybe others do to. I'd like to hope that everyone has something they can do that helps them feel better.<p>I still struggle with ADHD, I still have trouble sitting through a movie, I get frustrated at myself at the drop of a hat, hell, to be honest, theres a part of me that's proud I managed to type this story out in only one sitting. But I can program, and I honestly feel like that saved my life.",mwill,1350278253

"I can definitely relate to what you said, and I think sharing my journey through academia may at the very least give you some ideas in how to approach yours.<p><i>TL;DR at bottom</i><p>Lots of the usual helpful advice has been given to you already (meditation, medication, exercise, diet, lifestyle), and I don't want to discount it by any means as it's all extremely helpful to try to achieve some kind of life balance through pursuit of better habits which can definitely help you become more focused. Instead I'm going to tell you what I've learned, as I was in a similar situation 9 years ago, though whether my lot has been improved much through experience is probably open to debate.<p>I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 8, though I've come to feel that the broad range of symptoms that the label is applied is less of a binary trait and more of a spectrum of behavioral characteristics that everyone can relate to, some more than others. If you feel like you have it, you probably do, though getting the official seal of ""ADD"" is probably only useful in that it gives you a venue to legally obtain medication to help mitigate it, as I did; working my way through the pharmacopoeia until I eventually settled into a grudging partnership with Adderall, which I took throughout high school. And it WAS very useful for extended periods of focus and crunching before tests and exams.<p>The one catch: I absolutely hated it. It made me feel disconnected, gave me a serious case of cottonmouth, gave me some serious bad breath, and made it nearly impossible to maintain a healthy sleep habit and diet. It's not something I would recommend except as an absolute last resort.<p>College can be a cruel first test of one's ability to balance their commitments. Personally I found the barrage of new things I had to deal with on my own for the first time overwhelming, and didn't last long at my first institution (UIUC). At the same time, I can say that many of my obstacles were things I chose. Making friends, going to parties, getting involved with student groups, and social activities were all things that I chose over applying myself towards my coursework. And here's the thing: <i>I learned a lot!</i> But not about the things I was being tested on.<p>I don't want to ramble on with obsessive detail, but I will say that I finally graduated 9 1/2 years after enrolling in 2003, though much of that time was spent not in school. Here's what would have saved my parents and I a lot of money: As soon as my interest waned, I should have taken time off. I didn't because of family pressure. There's a poignant quote somewhere about not playing if your head's not in the game, I'm sure, and I wish I had taken heed.<p>The thing is, all the time spent partying, travelling, working crappy minimum wage jobs, and living outside of the the very small world that concerns itself with minute improvements to the travelling salesman problem, and whether P = NP, gave me a perspective that has finally motivated me to pursue a self-driven education on computer-science-related topics that I never had until <i>my very last semester</i> of college (which was Fall 2012). Do I regret it? Sure, there are loads of things I'd do differently, but through the whole process I've developed extracurricular skills I value and am generally much happier and fulfilled person than I would have been if I had graduated in 2008.<p>So what I'm getting at in what I've realized is an extremely roundabout way, is that if you don't feel like you're really ready to dive into what you're learning headfirst, if you don't feel COMPELLED to... then don't. Take some time off and do something else that you want. Consider another major or career path. Learn to play an instrument. Heck, join a circus troupe. If you think your CS curriculum is tough now, just wait until your junior and senior years. That's when the difficulty really starts to adopt a tune that has the palatability of nails-on-a-chalkboard.<p>Because of pressure from my parents mainly, I kept going back when I <i>knew with all the fabric of my essence that I wasn't ready</i> and trying to half-ass my way through my classes. And I kept getting chewed up and spat out so to speak by the difficulty of the material. Seriously, I ended up failing core computer science classes repeatedly because my head wasn't in the game, because I didn't understand why the concepts I was learning were important, or applicable to anything I was interested in doing at the time, and because I truly just wasn't ready. It's like trying to bike up a steep hill without enough forward momentum. You need to be in high gear and ready to bring it.<p>So what finally got me interested in learning the material? I've always been fairly certain that I want to build things with code. I considered everything from music to writing to psychology in throes of self-doubt, but what it came down to in the end was that nothing excites me the way computer technology does, which fortuitously enough happened to be my intended major from the get-go. But I had to learn a lot about everything else the other academic disciplines, and life in general, had to offer before I was comfortable making that decision.<p>TL;DR, as promised:<p>-Unless you want to medicate yourself (which may be unhealthy in the long run), you may have to put higher ed on hold until you're feeling it (I should have).<p>-The degree isn't as important as the knowledge. Motivate yourself to learn things that you're interested in for now. As your base of knowledge grows, you may find that more and more of your interests overlap with a computer science curriculum. In that case, go for the degree again. If not, consider majoring in or studying something else.<p>-Consider taking some time off from any kind of classical academic learning and instead use this time for other personal and emotional growth and self-discovery. Work and support yourself, if you're not already. Go on an enormous road trip. Spend some time volunteering for a cause that resonates with you.<p>-If you do decide to continue with school full-time, then do whatever you can to make it your only commitment. Tell the band they have to find a new drummer. Tell your best friend to find a new wingman. <i>Move in with your parents if possible or get whatever financial aid you can so that you don't have to work while you're in school</i>. Seriously, with this last one. It sounds lame, but if it may be the only thing that can get you through your junior and senior years of CS.",hmsimha,1366446327

I took meds for a while, but I felt like an amped-up zombie and stopped some time during college.<p>Kids have not always gone to school for full 7 hour days starting at age four or five, where they have been subject to strict rules that emphasize obedience to adults and &quot;sitting still.&quot; In fact, some research indicates that children at a young age learn best how to regulate themselves through play with other kids, including through games (that they themselves create) and role-playing. Kids figure out how to regulate themselves from each other, not from adults. (This could explain why increases in ADHD, bullying and teen suicide seem to be happening at the same time.)<p>I look back and think that at least in my case, this might explain a bit of my issues. In my case, I think there are probably underlying causes that are only now, years later, being looked at, including pretty serious trouble sleeping and some hormone problems. But I also think that I lacked the child-oriented play that kids really need, and was wound up in adult-guided activities where I didn&#x27;t learn to govern myself.<p>I&#x27;m not anti-schooling, but I do think that the schools have gotten too high-stakes at earlier ages, and we should probably limit younger kids to shorter school days and allow them to engage in relatively hands-off free play with each other.

So I quit the public sector and found a job in a company where I could be a programmer again, I made sure to find a company where I wouldn’t have to deal with a whole lot of the Atlassian sort bureaucracies surrounding programming and it’s frankly been a bliss.<p>I’ve gone from not thinking I could ever work more than 30 hours a week until my children left our house to back to full time.<p>So chances are you probably already know what kind of work you like, but it’s just really hard to figure it out. One thing that I thought I would miss was feeling “important” but the truth is that I was never actually “important”. If it hadn’t been me someone else would’ve done it.<p>(For reference I’m Danish, having a break down here gets you 6 months sick leave with pay and costs you basically nothing out of your own pocket. This made things easier to say the least.)",moksly,1640455039
"I was diagnosed with ADHD&#x2F;ADD relatively late (about 17). Before the diagnoses I’d tried planners, digital reminders, Pomodoro timers… but the only thing that’s consistently worked is medication. It’s hard to overstate just how much Adderall has improved my life and I’m positive I have a much happier life and higher income because of my altered ability to delay gratification and do long, boring tasks without issue. Highly recommend speaking to a doctor if you think you could benefit.",AJayWalker,1640396954
"I was diagnosed with ADHD in my 50&#x27;s. Without meds I have to spend an enormous amount of energy managing my cognitive state. Imagine you had to spend 60% of your time creatively managing yourself into a mental state where you can do something meaningful with the remaining 40%.  And I&#x27;ve been practicing meditation for 30 years, I&#x27;m very active, I&#x27;ve adapted my lifestyle around my needs.<p>All that work doesn&#x27;t even come close to the benefit I get from Vyvanse. I get effortless self control, and all that time back.<p>I figured out I had ADHD by observing my (very intelligent) daughter in kindergarten--she was the obvious behavioural outlier. All the other kids were mostly attending to the teacher, my daughter was attending to everything else. We didn&#x27;t medicate her until Grade 4, when she started to think she was dumb. Meds changed everything for her, allowed her to develop a better self-concept (and winning the academic prize that year). She&#x27;s off meds right now, struggling a bit, but a least she knows she&#x27;s not dumb. That&#x27;s huge.<p>Here&#x27;s my thinking: stimulants are relatively safe. They aren&#x27;t particularly addictive. Yes, they suck, there are tradeoffs. But if they don&#x27;t work out, you can stop. You can stop whenever you want.<p>But once a kid has internalized &quot;I&#x27;m dumb&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m a loser&quot; it is very hard to undo. That can stay with them for life.",rtikulit,1543533965

"I was diagnosed with ADD when I was young. I read tons of people on here urging others to &quot;get help&quot;. But what does that mean? Essentially there is only one thing a therapist can do. That is, prescribe you speed&#x2F;amphetamines. These will make anyone more focused, its a complete fallacy that they are proper medication for having ADD. When you take these drugs (which are neurotoxic at higher&#x2F;extended doses, a fact which is actively hidden by drug companies), you are seriously messing with your reward system. This makes them very hard to get off after taking them a while, as it can take months for your brain to go back to normal. Thats why people think they have such terrible ADD. Look! I cant focus without the meds! Well no wonder, they manipulated your brain chemistry at a huge level!",QandAandQ,1441033351
"I was diagnosed with ADHD around age 12 in early school. For about 10 years, I was on a lot of stimulant medication; Vyvanse, Adderall, Concerta, and tried many others. Only in the last couple years did I stop entirely. You get used to the sleep impairment after a while. It affected my ability to socialize. I was making excuses for my behavior and largely, I could summarize it as &quot;feeling like a zombie, entirely reliant on a pill.&quot; My opinion on it now is that it can help you, but now I prefer to be in my default mode, unencumbered by meds.",abrowne2,1612221060

"I was diagnosed with ADHD at a very young age, and have been doing battle with my attention span for most of my life. I had only read a half dozen books all the way through when I graduated from High School, despite reading at a college reading level before I was out of elementary school and having started hundreds of them. The few books that I had read included Les Miserables and War and Peace, both of which I binge-read over a period of a few days, barely allowing myself to eat and rarely allowing myself to shower while I read them. The other ones were Frindle, Tangerine, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time, and Catcher in the Rye. They were completely consuming. My addiction to video games was so intense and so severe that they were outright banned at my house. I was terrible at school, skipping more than half of my classes, but tested in the 99th percentile for standardized testing, learning a lot of what I should have learned in school by deduction as I was taking the test. That allowed me to get into college, which I later dropped out of, electing instead to buy a one-way ticket to China unsure if I would ever come back. Basically I was either 0% engaged in something or 110%, and if I wasn&#x27;t engaged it felt like no matter how hard I fought I couldn&#x27;t force myself to care.<p>The turning point came when I was living in eastern Ukraine serving a Mormon mission. As per the mission rules, the only books we read were scriptural, we only used a computer for 30 minutes a week to email home, and in my particular mission I spent 90% of my time, every minute from 11 AM to 9 PM (except for a one-hour dinner) walking around, talking to people in the streets.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it was age or that I was finally rid of the many stimulants I used to have, but my mind just slowed down. I concentrated on <i>everything</i>, and, perhaps especially because I was speaking Russian, I could literally recall every word of every conversation I had. I sat down in the mornings and studied the intricacies of the Russian language for an hour straight without blinking an eye. I read the Old Testament cover to cover; something that would have made me literally pull my hair out just a year earlier.<p>Then I went home. I got an iPhone, I got on the Internet, and it all came back. I try to limit the stimulants, (I&#x27;ve become very minimalistic), and I usually spend a lot of the morning with a calmer mind, but... I work online. I love the Internet. And I haven&#x27;t yet been able to calm my mind like it was for those two years.<p>It may be a matter of self-control - it probably is, but learning to program is incredibly painful. 10 minutes at a time sometimes with an incredible number of stops and starts.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer is, nor do I pretend that I can project my experience onto some greater understanding of what ADHD is, how to defeat it, or if it needs defeating, but the experience of feeling like I could finally do all the things I wanted to do because I didn&#x27;t have anything else to stimulate me was fascinating, and it may be valuable to someone else.",austenallred,1414898799
"&gt;Not to mention that by the time you get to your doctor, un-medicated, you will forget to tell about half of your symptoms.<p>This is actually a major problem. I was diagnosed with ADD as a child but gave up the medication in my late teens because it had side-effects I didn&#x27;t enjoy.<p>Late last year, I thought it might be worth trying it again, maybe with a milder dose. I booked an appointment with a doctor, who referred me to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist told me there was a two week waiting period and that they&#x27;d call me back in a few weeks, and never did. It was two months before I remembered to follow it up.<p>I don&#x27;t bore you with the rest of the details, but the short version is every medical professional I spoke to (and I spoke to about 5 during this saga) told me to wait and that they would organize something for me, and then didn&#x27;t. Turns out if you lie to someone with ADD and leave the organization ball in their court like that, they&#x27;ll never get treatment, because they struggle with the very thing you&#x27;re asking them to do. It&#x27;s pretty much the worst thing you can do for them.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve just realized I was planning to talk to the doctor about it again 4 months ago to try to get the ball rolling again. It&#x27;s Christmas now, they won&#x27;t be back at work until mid January. I&#x27;d better send myself an email, wish me luck.",_m7bj,1514646182

"Made an HN account just to reply to this.<p>I went to school in Kathmandu, Nepal and graduated high school in 2016. Currently I work as a programmer in NYC.<p>99% of my teachers were sadistic assholes who’d be in prison for child abuse in any first world country. I’d be rountinely beatup physically for not doing homework, for disturbing class, for not doing well in tests etc. Once in 7th grade, I was spanked on my thighs by a teacher so bad I could not walk for 3 days. In 2nd grade by headmaster beat me up with a cricket bat on my shoulders and back for not finishing half of my English homework. And I was one of the better students (average B+ equivalent) , a lot of my fellow classmates had it worse than me. Specially the ones who had a different mothertongue (not Nepali). This is mostly cultural. Often parents would tell teachers to punish kids more because their grades were not good enough. Most parents including mine were equally abusive at home. I remember the utter, frothing rage of teachers who would go fully ballistic at kids for the minorest offense.<p>Regardless of culture, I believe the system attracted the worst of worst (those who can’t, —- teach) scum of the society who would find pleasure in hurting the helpless. You might think this is an outlier case but this is still the norm for the majority in Nepal and I believe a lot of third world countries.<p>After attending college in the states, I was diagnosed with ADHD, which no one knows about back home. It has taken me years in therapy to make peace with this and I’m still filled with horror and rage when I think about it. I don’t know what I can do about this, but my heart breaks when I think of hundreds of thousands of kids who are still going through this.<p>There were a couple (literally 3) teachers I fondly remember who were kind and tried to make their subjects interesting.

"This really shouldn&#x27;t be a shocker.  I was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary school and have been on and off medication ever since.  A large number of friends in the professional world use these stimulants regularly.<p>I think that these drugs are very useful for short term sprints where one needs to focus, or do rather mundane tasks.  But it&#x27;s incredibly easy to become dependent on them.  At one point, I could even begin to focus unless I had the max dose of adderall and a strong cup of coffee.<p>I don&#x27;t judge anyone who uses stimulants to increase performance.  Just because I was diagnosed with ADHD doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m not using them as a performing enhancing drug; it&#x27;s just legal for me to do so.  However, I would encourage everyone - whether you&#x27;re prescribed or not - to use them in moderation.  It&#x27;s very easy to build up a tolerance and become dependent, and once you&#x27;re dependent, you&#x27;re no better off than where you started.",ryan90,1429455373

"No, of course it&#x27;s completely logical generalise the whole field of psychology and the diagnosis and treatment of complex mental disorders from the singular experience you had - especially when they&#x27;ve told you they&#x27;re trying to get you the most help they can from various government bureaucracies. It&#x27;s also perfectly logical to just take a face value your child&#x27;s teacher&#x27;s opinion that &quot;they&#x27;re fine&quot; when they&#x27;ve got 20+ other children to worry about and monitor.

"I was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive) when I was a senior in college. My oldest son was diagnosed a year ago, when he was in first grade.<p>I began to suspect my son might have it when he was frustrated at learning to read—especially when he reported that distractions in the classroom (such as a new pencil sharpener) were making it difficult for him to focus. At home, I noticed that he was much more effective—and self-confident—when he did his reading in our basement den, away from his younger siblings and other distractions.<p>We took him to a prominent local child psychologist, who spent a few hours with us—first with me, going over my observations, his history, family, etc.; then with him alone. A few weeks later, we received a ~10-page report with his assessment, which included results from a battery of tests he had done with my son, concluding with a diagnosis of ADHD. Based on this, our pediatrician had us try a couple of different stimulants, and we&#x27;ve landed on Vyvanse as the best combination of convenience and efficacy. The difference has been staggering—not only with his progress at school, but most importantly, his self-confidence has risen remarkably.<p>I haven&#x27;t read it, but the title of one ADHD book—&quot;You Mean I&#x27;m Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!&quot;—has stuck with me. Growing up with undiagnosed ADHD, I often felt that I was simply inadequate, or not trying hard enough. Of course, personal responsibility still plays a role, but I now understand more what&#x27;s going on.<p>Medication has markedly improved my life as well. But I think being diagnosed in early adulthood meant that I still had to deal with years of bad habits, self-esteem issues, perception by family and friends, transcripts filled with bad-to-mediocre grades...<p>Both my son and I present the inattentive side of ADHD more than the hyperactive side, but I suspect the results would be similar.<p>Getting my son&#x27;s diagnosis started with his pediatrician, who recommended the child psychologist. I&#x27;d suggest starting there.<p>BTW, the reason I think my son was diagnosed earlier is due to the curriculum: it&#x27;s simply more challenging at an early age than what I remember. I was able to coast on intelligence alone until I was a teenager, when I finally had schoolwork that required sustained concentration. My son was being asked to read books in first grade that I probably didn&#x27;t read until second grade—and there wasn&#x27;t nearly the systematic focus on it. My suspicion is that the increased diagnoses of ADHD is due in large part to this—it&#x27;s always been prevalent, but has been less of a burden in the past (career options, too—so many ADHD-compatible jobs are getting automated away).",organsnyder,1543529631
I have ADHD and even 7 minutes of guided meditation does wonders for my restless mind in the morning. But mostly I feel out of habit and have not gotten back into it. I was diagnosed with ADHD at 25 so spend most of my life with racing thoughts.<p>The clarity I got from meditation was nice but it also feels like it impairs the way I am used to my brain working so the trade off was not really welcomed.<p>I cut my caffeine consumption drastically (several expressos a day to 1 regular cup) which helped with racing thoughts and started taking melatonin before bed which helps prevent me staying awake trying to sleep for hours. Those two things also came from meditation but I&#x27;m able to get them elsewhere now without losing some of the creativity I find in my thought patterns during the day.,Taylor_OD,1637074363
"I think this is an excellent way to help some kids cope with adhd, but I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d work universally. Reading this made me think back on my own struggle with adhd.<p>A few years ago I was diagnosed with adhd at the age of 23, and god damn do I wish it happened a decade sooner, but my parents were the type that didn&#x27;t believe in that kind of stuff, so I was just lazy. It&#x27;s stuck with me to this day even, it took me a while to come to terms with it and I at times I still think I&#x27;m lying to myself and I&#x27;m just lazy, and would never make this post on my main account.<p>I first started seriously considering that it might be something other than just laziness in college when I was studying for finals with some friends and we decided to enhance that studying with some adderall. Everyone got super focused, churning out work and wide awake for hours, except me. I felt pretty much nothing different at first, and was kinda pissed it didn&#x27;t work, but got to studying anyways. The next day I was complaining to my friend about my apparent immunity to amphetamines, and thinking back I realized it might&#x27;ve had an effect after all. Instead of jumping around and doing 50 things at once in no logical order I actually stayed more or less on one thing at a time. I didn&#x27;t get the apparent super human focus and metal boost, and it didn&#x27;t keep me awake for shit, but I got to pick what I focused on. My friend mentioned that having that kind of reaction to stimulants might be a possible symptom of add, but I didn&#x27;t take that seriously, since everything is apparently a symptom of add.<p>Later on I finally got a job with my own health insurance, and went to a therapist for an unrelated reason. Through multiple sessions I unloaded the story of my life, how I could never pay attention to just one thing when I was younger, but I saw it as an advantage because I could context switch between 10 things got damn good at it. How I loved driving so much because thinking about every other car on the road with me and predicting their actions all at once put my mind at ease. But as I got older, the 10 things I tried to focus on each needed a lot more focus than my rapid context switching could provide. It had gotten to the point that holding a conversation was a troubling task because I&#x27;d also be thinking about 10 other things and losing bits and pieces of it.<p>The first time my therapist told me that I may have adhd, I was actually insulted. I didn&#x27;t want to consider the possibility that something was actually wrong with me, I was just lazy and needed to get my shit together.  I never outwardly acted out as a kid, I wasn&#x27;t hyperactive, there was no way I could have adhd. I later realized that a lot of my outlet went into computers instead, where for me the adhd was actually helpful.<p>I continued my sessions, and eventually she convinced me to see a psychiatrist. Over a few visits he also diagnosed me with adhd. I refused to take the prescription and ended up going to two other doctors that gave me the same diagnoses. I finally relented and worked with my therapist and the psychiatrist to set a plan of action. I was prescribed adderall, which I took daily for 3 months. At the same time I also started working on behaviors and methods to cope with it without medication. It was a night and day difference. I remember 2 weeks in sitting in my room almost in tears thinking &quot;is this how normal people think all the time? They can choose? Why the fuck couldn&#x27;t I have that&quot;.<p>After the first 3 months I started skipping my meds for one week out of every month to gauge how well I could deal without. It took about 7 months until I was confident enough to go off of it, but it feels like I never did. As much as I hate pharmaceuticals, there&#x27;s no way I could&#x27;ve gotten to where I am today without. I genuinely feel that I&#x27;ve managed to change something in my brain to a less chaotic process. I didn&#x27;t even know there was another way to think, I thought that was normal. Sure, it&#x27;s still a struggle, and I still have my moments, but I can actually manage my life. I can decide to clean my apartment and not end up starting 5 other projects after 20 minutes of cleaning. The amount of shit I could have accomplished had I been able to handle my mind a decade earlier.<p>Sorry for the long winded rant, but damn it feels good to actually put that into words. I&#x27;m still ashamed in a way of it, it makes me feel &quot;broken&quot; I guess, so no one but my doctors and I know and writing that was a bit of a relief.  I&#x27;m honestly not sure what my point of writing this was, other that to say that while giving kids heavy amphetamines is probably not a great idea, doing something to help from a young age could be massively life changing, and if nothing else is helping, waiting too long for medication probably isn&#x27;t a great idea either.",greys0ul,1453980796

"I was diagnosed with ADHD, and while these criteria might have led to the testing, the actual testing was relatively scientific. There was a several hour battery of tests where my scores were compared against average. Most of the tests were relatively boring, like a computer screen would show letters, and you were supposed to hit the space bar for every character except Xs. People with ADHD performance at that task degrades much more quickly over time vs people without. There were also tests where people would employ different memory strategies to do them, and people with ADHD tend to use particularly poor ones. The doctor would read a list of 12 words, and you were supposed to recite it back. Then he'd tell you what words you missed, and you'd try to say the whole list again. Most people can get the whole list in 3-4 tries.<p>They also did an IQ test and the scores on all the ADHD tests were compared to what would be expected for my IQ.

Not all ADHD cases need to be medicated.  Find what works for you, whatever the hell that is, and don&#x27;t listen to dogma.

Because they have trouble keeping their lives organized in an age of smartphones and constant media bombardment. But doesn&#x27;t everyone?<p>&gt; <i>Some ads suggest that symptoms as common as difficulty with multitasking, focusing, and stress, as well as poor planning, procrastination, and disorganization can all be symptoms of ADHD. (They can also, as one former Cerebral nurse says, “simply be attributed to being an adult in 2022.”)</i><p>While this article is particular to Cerebral, they are not the only offenders. There is a whole cottage industry around convincing people with mild organizational problems that they have ADHD, even in &quot;traditional&quot; psychiatry. It&#x27;s happened to family members and friends of mine.<p>I was diagnosed with ADHD and went through an Adderall -&gt; Vyvanse -&gt; Ritalin pipeline. I eventually settled on using half of the smallest available dose of Ritalin (5mg&#x2F;2 = 2.5mg) and that is plenty for me.

"I sort of disagree that a hobby can’t be doing the same thing over and over. I know because it sure is for me. I was diagnosed with ADHD around 36 when I had my first child and simultaneously was getting in to higher management, never before realising that my coping-mechanism had been going to be early. I mean, I knew it was a stress coping mechanism, but I only had to do it in really intense weeks, which was maybe 6-10 times a year, so it was just part of life.<p>Anyway, having a child destroyed that as well as my need for solitude to re-energise (another thing I wasn’t too aware or). Long story short I ended up with a diagnosis and a suggestion that I found myself a hobby, much like the author. I picked Blood Bowl which is Warhammer American football, and as such is a miniature hobby where you buy and glue together and then paint little plastic dolls.<p>One of the things I enjoy the most is actually putting the miniatures together, and while I do kitbash (creativity) some of them, the real mindfulness comes from the cleaning, the preparing and the painting the same red on 16 figures.<p>Years later I know that this is exactly why I mostly stopped programming professionally and got into management. I actually really enjoy programming, even if it’s the same stupid for loop over and over, what I don’t enjoy is co-operating with project managers and clients, constantly making creative changes rather than just implementing something. That sort of programming burned me out and that eventually pushes me into architecture and later when my bosses saw potential in me into management.<p>I can see how taking commissions for clay cups would be similar to that. But I don’t think that always making cups would not make it a hobby just because there is less creativity in it.",moksly,1630390794
"I felt more socially confident (perhaps not confident exactly, though that was an aspect -- more strident). My sleep was at healthy times, for slightly longer, but the difference between being &#x27;asleep&#x27; and &#x27;awake&#x27; was, well, night and day. Rather than the slow, drawn-out waking, for which there&#x27;s a gateway to very negative appraisal of the world. When I came back, I binged, heavily.<p>&#x27;In tatters&#x27;, hmm... My self-regulation is poor but I&#x27;m desperately trying to claw upwards, so I have erected a lot of barriers between me and my lovely but drug-addicted friends, which gives me a lot of free time. I spend a lot of time purposefully and sanely researching things I want to learn, where I should learn them from, then feeling pooped out and gawping in front of YouTube or Reddit, then blaming myself for wasting time etc etc. It&#x27;s hard to summarise, to be honest. Feeling &#x27;locked-up&#x27; and &#x27;scattered&#x27;, maybe? I&#x27;m often exhausted by reading Reddit, it really feels like work. Honestly, I feel like I spend most days working intensely and not sleeping enough to manage it. Despite spending most of my time gaining weight on a desk chair, and not actually working.<p>I&#x27;m very gullible. I tend to remember a lot of what I read, and I&#x27;m naturally full of doubt, and over-analytical. So reading a thousand conflicting opinions on subjects makes me... A little loopy and conflicted. Like I&#x27;m always in last place, trying to catch up with the &#x27;right&#x27; opinion on everything. There was a Reddit thread for the OP&#x27;s link just today, where someone mentioned arguing with their girlfriend like an anonymous Redditor - I also definitely empathise with that one.<p>I have problems with eye contact, for sure, I tend to &#x27;fall into&#x27; it if I look too long, as it seems to me to be a remarkably intense thing to hold eye contact for longer than an instant.<p>I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI in September, and haven&#x27;t gotten on medication for it just yet (I&#x27;ve been disorganised...). I think reddit-like media is particularly bad for people like us. They say ADHD is more of a working memory disorder than anything, and I think we need our cache clearing regularly, let&#x27;s say. A Reddit addiction tops it up at every opportunity.",rwnspace,1514325697
"I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 13 when my parents were at a loss as to why I could not focus on my schoolwork and homework. They gave me Ritalin at the time, which only made me hostile (their words; I don&#x27;t recall)",orangepurple,1651454373
"I was diagnosed with ADHD 10 years ago. Tried a few drugs, and while it definitely helped with the ADHD symptoms, the other side effects that affected my daily life were too much.<p>I switched my diet from a high carb to high protein, high fat. Instead of a bagel for breakfast, I&#x27;ll eat a couple eggs, a breakfast meat, and every once in a while a piece of toast. Tons of whole fresh fruit all day. Lunch is similar: think a chipotle style meal with a base of protein and rice and some light veggies. More fruit and raw vegetables and nuts for snacks. Dinner is the same thing - protein base but fewer carbs and more veggies. I&#x27;ll have some candy in the evening from time to time.<p>I also started lifting weights 3x a week. I love it cause it&#x27;s the most efficient way for me to exercise - I spend 60-120 minutes in the gym three times and work my whole body. Heavy squats, deadlifts and presses - strengthens the back and hips, makes sitting in a chair much easier, and is a really great vector for activating that hyperfocus we love so much. I read a book called Starting Strength that basically gave me all the info I needed to get started.<p>Since starting this routine about 8 or 9 years ago, I find I&#x27;m sleeping better, my focus is way better, I&#x27;m much more pleasant to be around socially, I&#x27;m way less impulsive and interruptive, I make fewer stupid rash decisions, and I&#x27;m generally in a better, chipper mood a lot more.<p>Edit: Might add: I drink coffee like it&#x27;s going out of style and don&#x27;t find that caffeine really affects my focus all that much - more my energy levels. They&#x27;re similar but on different axes.",hoorayimhelping,1579817213

"It&#x27;s all anecdotal, but:<p>When I was an adolescent I was diagnosed with ADD after a few days of examination, and was recommended adderall, which my pareents thankfully refused.<p>My mom told her GP she had trouble focusing and was prescribed adderall pretty much willy nilly.<p>I know quite a few people who are perpetually on SSRIs for anxiety or depression, yes it works as a palliative measure for some but I do question both the long term efficacy, if the magnitude of the side effect and dependence risks are understated, and most importantly whether or not the patients worked hard at all of the endogenous variables relating to their lifestyle to optimize for happiness before <i>slavishly</i> accepting their diagnosis.<p>I don&#x27;t like that the conspiracy nut &#x2F; tinfoil hat &#x2F; anti science pejorative gets thrown around so easily as an argument ender in discussions like this.  It is most definitely NOT scientific how these diagnoses are done, it&#x27;s heuristic based, it&#x27;s based on observed models and patterns, obviously, since we barely have slightest idea about how our brain is working under the hood &#x2F; how it differs among individuals &#x2F; what leads to long term convalescence.<p>So, for some people, diet, exercise, getting out of unproductive or toxic relationships&#x2F;jobs, can help, for others, they need the boost of an SSRI or something to get out of the bog, etc. but I definitely suspect that very many people are prematurely getting pushed to the latter option without fully exploring the former, as was the case with my mother and I (except with focus issues instead of depression, though i suspect they&#x27;re related)<p>Think of the parent commenter -- Say he went to a doctor or a psychiatrist with his issues.  How much time do you think they would spend with him before getting to the point of prescribing him something to take care of his issues.  Maybe 10 hours max?  Probably more like 2 or 3?  Often times less?  Whereas he is obviously a thoughtful, intelligent, and diligent person who has probably spent years responsibly experimenting on what works for him and found that it is marijuana.  Yet that would never even be an <i>option</i> for the docs to prescribe to him.  So if he were to <i>slavishly</i> follow what you deem as &quot;science&quot;, he would be stuck in the paradigm that he needs an SSRI or benzo or whatever it may be.  Whereas by being anti-scientific, and self-medicating, he&#x27;s here telling us how happy&#x2F;successful he is.<p>Another more prominent example would be the opioid crisis.",handsomechad,1534816883

"&gt; How would their ancestors have been surviving for all those thousands of years before Ritalin had been invented?<p>Different demands. I was diagnosed with ADHD and started medication. At that time, I was an engineer doing the problematic, bleeding-edge R&amp;D-ish stuff pretty much by myself with close support of a small team and needed to focus, something that never came easy to me. The company was acquired, I moved on and accepted a technical management position at a much smaller place. Being constantly interrupted annoyed me and I stopped the medication (my psychiatrist agreeing). Without it, I felt again more at ease spread over more, different tasks.<p>So, to answer your question, people survived by doing jobs that didn&#x27;t demand the kind of focus that&#x27;s difficult for people with ADHD.<p>Such jobs, sadly, are not abundant anymore or evenly distributed geographically.",rbanffy,1464884123

"I&#x27;m not the person you originally asked, but I can give my experience.<p>I was diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive last December, so I&#x27;ve been on a very low dose of what I&#x27;m told is basically just timed-release adderall for about 4 months.<p>So far it&#x27;s been positive. I find it helps me change contexts more easily and not bounce off of the new context and revert to phone scrolling. It helps me get over that activation hump more easily I think as well. One effect that I didn&#x27;t anticipate is since I started on it I find I sleep better, wake up groggy less, and have an easier time getting out of bed in the morning.<p>That&#x27;s probably partly related to this: I had to cut out caffeine almost entirely because it would make my heart race. If I want coffee I can have decaf that seems ok. I can have a mug of tea but if I have two my heart is pounding. Same with soda. I used to drink a can of diet coke a day. There is caffeine free diet coke too which I have but I find I drink it much less frequently.<p>The heart racing has been the only negative side effect I&#x27;ve noticed and cutting out caffeine has fixed it so overall that&#x27;s probably for the best.<p>Sorry for the snark before. I don&#x27;t actually know if Adderall is prescribed anymore, it might be. When I was looking for advice on how to approach a doctor about a possible ADHD diagnosis as an adult one of the things I was told was &quot;don&#x27;t mention medication, especially not Adderall, they might think you&#x27;re drug seeking.

I was having a hard time learning to read, just moved to a new school, and was supposed to go into 2nd, but was held back because of my reading level. Once I was medicated I improved so much, I went from hating school to actually wanting to go and spend time with my friends. It also helped me to stay in control, it brought me down to a normal level.<p>It&#x27;s really interesting that you used the story of him knocking something over. I can think of many times I have knocked something over or touched something and broke it. I remember when I smack myself or just break down. I did this when I was younger and yeah it&#x27;s a feeling that will be hard for him to control. I felt like an idiot and that I ruined everything when it happened. Just build him up and let him know it is okay!<p>It&#x27;s hard to make a recommendation but going to a neurologist and also seeing a therapist have been huge. That helped with the medication and diagnostic.<p>What has helped with everything is exercising and eating clean. There was an article posted recently that showed children&#x27;s test scored improved by 10% (not positive on the 10 but it was enough) when they did cardio before tests. I know and feel totally different when I have exercised. It&#x27;s hard to tell a child that they need to run or do some form of exercise, but getting them out and running around with them will do so much. Also not eating food with food coloring or sugar will be so helpful as well. It&#x27;s simple but it is super key.<p>TL;DR: Go see a neurologist&#x2F;Therapist. You don&#x27;t need to medicate, and it&#x27;s not the only solution, but it has helped me. Read as much as you can on ADHD. Exercise. (Scooters are hot right now)",jimkri,1543683295

"I&#x27;ve struggled with suicidal thoughts throughout my entire life, as far back as I can remember. Both of my parents struggle with untreated mental illness that had a major impact on my upbringing. They were often very emotionally abusive and sometime physically abusive throughout my childhood. There was no such thing as positive reinforcement in our household, we lived our childhoods just trying not be punished and it was at times very difficult.  When I went through a divorce in my early 30&#x27;s, I called my mom to break the news and she responded by screaming at the top of her lungs at me. She would later tell me that she was trying to scare me into making sure that I had made the right decision. That night was closest I had come to crossing the rubicon in many years. I still don&#x27;t fully understand how a mother could talk their child this way in such a difficult moment, but such is life.<p>Years later, I was diagnosed with ADHD which answered so many deep questions about why I am the way I am (and why my parents are the way they are). Life is simply harder for folks with ADHD, we struggle with executive function in ways that neurotypical folks don&#x27;t often think about.<p>Strangely, one of most impactful moments towards reducing my recurring suicidal thoughts involved magic mushrooms. During a trip, I visualized telling all of the people in my life that I wanted to leave, explaining in detail why I didn&#x27;t want to live anymore.

Whereas in fast forward I find my full attention is occupied enough that I&#x27;m able to hit a very input-only mode which is desirable when consuming information outside of discussion<p>That said, after years of watching everything with at least 1.5x, I&#x27;m starting to experience some minor issues such as falling asleep in Teams meetings (&amp; then watching the recording at 1.5x when I wake up)<p>Some parallels with Philip K Dick&#x27;s <i>Martian Time-Slip</i>",__s,1588538002
"Another anecdote from someone on HN, which probably biases pretty hard for people who have had success medicating ADHD. I dropped out of a bottom tier state school at 19 studying CS with essentially a 0.0. In my mid 20s I was diagnosed with ADHD by a GP and a psychiatrist and got a second opinion from a second psychiatrist who said the first two were wrong. I stopped medication because of sentiment like that expressed in the article. A year or two later I decided I didn&#x27;t like what I was doing, and wanted to return to school. I saw a second GP and got rediagnosed and prescribed. I&#x27;m now studying CS at a top 5 university with a 4.0.<p>My personal opinion is that there is more harm from the negative stigma associated w&#x2F; ADHD prescription than good, but you can imagine I would be biased given my narrative.",drawnwren,1494034308
"I was molested &amp; bullied as a kid, starting between 3-5 years old. It traumatized me. I started withdrawing emotionally into video games and television at age 8 or sooner. I was diagnosed with ADD after 8th grade. I added porn and learning about tech at age 12 to my avoidance habits. I entered into recovery for information, gaming, porn, masturbation, sex, love, and sugar addictions at age 32.<p>I was accused for years of being autistic in some way. Nope...I simply disconnected emotionally at an early age and didn&#x27;t learn to actually feel my feelings until 20+ years after I was biologically supposed to. Anxiety was my norm and I didn&#x27;t know it because I didn&#x27;t know what anxiety was.<p>The fact that I could go so long without basic lessons on what emotions are, how we feel them physically in the body, and what to do with them is a damning commentary on our society.<p>The fact that my trauma went unrecognized as such, even by me, til 32 is a damning commentary on psychology.<p>I&#x27;ve been feeling my feelings for 2.5 years and it started as a direct result of me saying aloud to myself while alone &quot;That traumatized me.&quot; The next moment was a flood of emotions, including excitement over whatever this flood of emotions was or could lead to and how weird it was that simply saying words out loud could lead to it.<p>I now think everyone could benefit from making a list of things they think didn&#x27;t traumatize them that other people have been historically traumatized by before, consider how their personal story lines up with standard stories of denial, and then consider the idea that they were traumatized in ways they don&#x27;t yet realize while saying &quot;That traumatized me.&quot;",crawfordcomeaux,1544897819
"man fuck articles like this. I was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary. school was extremely difficult for me and I even flunked grade 2, but was pushed onto the next grade after my parents complained. My parents didn&#x27;t believe in giving me the meds. I graduated high school with honors, but it took hours and hours of study because I was never able to focus. Then I started university... I was completely overwhelmed and dropped out. We&#x27;ve built a society where its a detriment not to be able to focus, denying your children a level playing field is absolutely cruel.",nothrows,1521306996
"I wanted to share my experience with Adderall. I&#x27;ve been taking it for about 2 months now. Some backstory.<p>I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was about 12. I never had an issue focusing in school. I never had any challenges completing my school work and would always complete it before everyone else. I would then get bored and fidget. It got to the point where it was a distraction to others and was brought to my parents&#x27; attention. I was then diagnosed with ADHD. I was never given any formal treatment, instead placed in a Gifted program with more intensive work.<p>I have been running my own businesses and consulting pretty much since I graduated high school. I am now 25. Things were going pretty good, except for one thing, deadlines. I struggled actually focusing and completing work. It got to the point where I could be working in my office for 12 hours straight and not actually get anything done.<p>The other major part of it is how it affects my relationships, especially with my SO. We can be holding a conversation and I can completely zone out for minutes at a time and not have any clue what she said because I was in my own head thinking. It is stressful because it gives the impression that I don&#x27;t care what she is saying, but in reality I have limited to no control over it. This is common from others I speak with who have ADHD.<p>I have tried every management system in the book. None of it helped. I eventually tried Modafinil (I see a few people mentioned it here). I ultimately stopped taking it because I didn&#x27;t like how it made me feel (restlessness and appetite loss) and I didn&#x27;t get immense boosts to concentration.<p>I eventually decided that I may want to try Adderall. My doctor was suggesting that I may want to try something for over a year, but I resisted. In my mind Adderall was prescription meth and would &quot;rot my brain&quot;. I would be come addicted and it would ruin my life.<p>But things just kept getting worse. My business keeps growing, and so are my responsibilities and deadlines, but I was really struggling to keep up. Finally, I decided to open my mind to taking something like Adderall.<p>After discussing it with my Doctor he alleviated most of my concerns. Ritalin and subsequently Adderall have been prescribed for almost 70 years and he has been prescribing them for decades without seeing &quot;brain rot&quot;, withdraw, or anything like that long-term. After more research and discussing it with colleagues I decided to take it. Here are my thoughts and observations 2 months in.<p>* It&#x27;s not addictive. I take it 1-2x a day when working, and not on weekends. I skipped 5 days of doses over Christmas without feeling the need to take it.<p>* Tolerance. You will get a euphoric effect the first 1-2x you take it, then you don&#x27;t anymore. You still get the concentration benefits and that doesn&#x27;t wear off over time - according to my doctor. I don&#x27;t feel the need to increase dosages.<p>* It has a propensity for abuse. Basically people taking it to stay up for days at a time to study for exams... I can see where people would have the urge to do so, though I do not.<p>* It helps me concentrate. While it&#x27;s not a magic solution to all of my problems, it makes it easier for me to be able to work and continue working for a long period of time. My productivity the past to months have been more than I ever have in the past 5 years.<p>* It lowers your appetite. I feel like I perpetually ate 30 minutes ago. I need to consciously decide to eat, which I do.
* It gives me dry mouth. This is annoying, no matter how much I drink.<p>* It can affect sleep. To counteract this I take mine when I first wake up, then at 12pm I take either a full dose, half dose, or nothing depending on my day.<p>TLDR: It has helped me improve the quality of my life with no real negative effects. If Adderall continues to do so, I will continue to take it.",zachruss92,1514661808
"This kind of hunger is what I&#x27;ve felt my whole life too, though my weight is still only in the overweight category. I can eat twice, three times what a normal portion is and still feel like I <i>need</i> to eat. I could easily eat multiple large pizzas by myself with no problem at all. There&#x27;s a scene from The West Wing where the chief of staff describes his alcoholism and how people would ask him how could he drink so much and still want more. His answer is that he doesn&#x27;t understand how anybody else could not want more. That it&#x27;s the best thing in the world. And that&#x27;s exactly how food feels to me.<p>A year ago I was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive) and prescribed a very low dose of Vyvanse (amphetamine based). Suddenly it was gone. I&#x27;d want to eat at normal times, I&#x27;d eat a normal portion but I could easily walk away or I actually just didn&#x27;t want more.  I asked my wife, is this what other people feel like? It really rocked my world a bit. It&#x27;s one thing to logically know that people experience reality differently, but I&#x27;ve rarely had such a stark example of it.",Alacart,1652566206
Not sure if you looked up &quot;sluggish cognitive tempo&quot; on Wikipedia yet. Give that a read. Have you experienced a head injury in your life&#x27;s? I experienced a traumatic brain injury after being hit by a car in my early 20s. I never returned to my former cognitive pace until I was diagnosed with ADD by a doctor who couldn&#x27;t say for sure that it was caused by the head injury but who suggested I try a mild stimulant to test the result.<p>The stimulant did the trick. I got my life back. Talk to your doctor and talk to a psychologist or neuropsychologist.,flycaliguy,1442165689
"TL;DR I have ADHD and it made me a better person<p>I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid. I received many different types of drugs and treatments that, IMO, didn't work. I barely passed the 3rd grade, failed the 6th grade and dropped out of school when I was a junior.<p>I was also a gifted artist, like my father, I could draw anything. I wasn't fantastic but it came easily to me. At 16 I picked up the guitar and quickly learned how to play and was proficient after a month.<p>These experiences made me question why I was good in some areas but failed in others. By the time I was 19 I gave up ALL drugs I was taking for ADHD and started my own treatment of ""taking responsibility for my life.""<p>This was the hardest thing I ever had done. At that time I was reading at a 6th grade level and has no prospects for jobs. I went to live with my grandparents and received the best education of my life. Discipline. They were farmers.<p>After 2 months I knew I had to leave and make a life for myself. I was scared and afraid but I had started reading self-help books and when tested again at the department of vocational rehabilitation I was reading 4-5 years ahead of my current age. My spatial skills were off the charts (their words).<p>I knew I had something special about myself that I could work with. I knew that if I worked hard I could do anything even if it took me longer to accomplish it I could do it.<p>I started by working my way up a janitorial company. I learned spanish in 6 months using Neuro Linguistic Programming techniques. I met my future wife and got married. I started putting computers together for the purpose of playing video games. I loved it. I was good at it. I eventually worked as a tech for a big box store and then worked in IT at a large insurance company when I found out I was going to be a father.<p>I learned everything I could about Active Directory. I then learned Perl as my first programming language and automated most of my job. I then started making games at home and learning as many languages as possible. I felt unstoppable.<p>Then my wife and I were having problems. Not huge problems but enough to get help. We sought counseling and happened to meet with a woman who studied ADHD as a specialty during her phD. Within 1 hour she said to me, ""You know you have ADHD right?""<p>My heart sank. All those years of failure came rushing back to me. I thought it was crap. A ruse. A mis-diagnosis. How could I have accomplished so much. How could I have gone back to college and graduated with a 4.0 for my associates in comp sci and 3.8 for my bachelors. How could I learn all those languages and read over 500 books.<p>I had to come to grips with the fact that I still had it. But I made it work for me and it was unfortunately affecting my relationship with my wife. We were able to come to an understanding about who I am and accepting the way I think.<p>Now, I make games for iOS fulltime. From home. ADHD isn't a death sentence. It's only a disorder if it's making your life harder.",DamagedProperty,1364916910
